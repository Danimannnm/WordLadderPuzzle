Outlined Path to Complete the Project
Dictionary and Graph Construction:

Load a dictionary from a file or API.
Construct a graph where each word is a node and edges connect words differing by one letter.
Validate intermediate words against the dictionary.
Implement Search Algorithms:

Start with Breadth-First Search (BFS) as itâ€™s conceptually straightforward for finding the shortest transformation in an unweighted graph.
Implement Uniform Cost Search (UCS), incorporating the cost function g(n).
Implement A Search* by defining an appropriate heuristic h(n) (e.g., the number of differing letters between the current word and target word).
Develop the Game Logic:

Allow players to choose between manual play and AI-assisted hints.
Integrate the search algorithms to provide hints or auto-solve puzzles.
Keep track of the number of moves and calculate scores accordingly.
UI/UX and Visualization:

Decide on a user interface framework (console-based, tkinter, or pygame).
If using a GUI, design the game window, display the word ladder, and optionally visualize the graph.
Ensure that the user can select game modes and difficulty levels.
Testing & Documentation:

Write unit tests for each component, especially your search algorithms.
Document the code and the logic behind each major decision.
Prepare a final report outlining your approach, challenges, and how you integrated each part.
